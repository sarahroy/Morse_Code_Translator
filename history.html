        <h2 class="para1-title">What is Morse Code?</h2><br>
        <p class="para1">
            The term Morse Code refers to either of two systems for representing letters of the alphabet, numerals, and punctuation marks by an arrangement of dots (dit), dashes (dah), and spaces. The codes are transmitted as electrical pulses of varied lengths or analogous mechanical or visual signals, such as flashing lights. The two systems are the original “American” Morse Code and the later International Morse Code, which became the global standard.
        </p><br><br>
        <h2 class="para1-title">Who invented Morse Code?</h2><br>
        <p>
            One of the systems was invented in the United States by American artist and inventor, Samuel F.B. Morse, during the 1830s for electrical telegraphy. This version was further improved by American scientist and businessman Alfred Lewis Vail, Morse's assistant and partner. Soon after its introduction in Europe, it became apparent that the original Morse Code was inadequate for the transmission of much non-English text, since it lacked codes for letters with diacritic marks. To remedy this deficiency, a variant called the International Morse Code was devised by a conference of European nations in 1851. This newer code is also called Continental Morse Code.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The two systems are similar, but the International Morse Code is simpler and more precise. For example, the original Morse Code used patterns of dots and spaces to represent a few of the letters, whereas the International Morse uses combinations of dots and short dashes for all letters. In addition, the International Morse Code uses dashes of constant length rather than the variable lengths used in the original Morse Code.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The International Morse Code has, except for some minor changes in 1938, remained the same since its inception. (The American telegraph industry never abandoned the original Morse Code, and so its use continued until the spread of teleprinters in the 1920s and '30s.) International Morse Code was used in World War II and in the Korean and Vietnam wars. It was used heavily by the shipping industry and for the safety of the seas up until the early 1990s. Although amateur radio made up only a small part of Morse Code usage, it did prepare many hundreds of operators for military duty in communications. In the early 2000s most countries had dropped the ability to decipher Morse Code from the requirements for obtaining an amateur radio license.

        <h2>Real World Examples of Morse Code</h2><br>
        <h3>Admiral Jeremiah Denton blinks Morse Code as a P.O.W.</h3>
        <p>
            On July 18, 1965, U.S. Navy Commander Jeremiah A. Denton Jr., was shot down while leading an air attack on a military installation in North Vietnam. Captured by the North Vietnamese that day, he remained a prisoner of war for seven years and seven months, enduring years of solitary confinement and brutal mistreatment.<br><br>

            On May 2, 1966, as part of a propaganda campaign, the North Vietnamese arranged for him to be interviewed for television by a Japanese reporter. Asked about his views on the actions of the U.S. Government, he strongly affirmed his government's position, in defiance of his captors' instructions; he prepared himself for a torture session that was sure to follow.<br><br>
            While speaking on camera, he blinked in Morse code the word <b>“T-O-R-T-U-R-E”</b>. Eventually, the videotape was widely circulated and reviewed by U.S. Naval Intelligence. Denton's one-word report, delivered in Morse code, was the first clear confirmation received by U.S. Intelligence that American POWs were, in fact, being tortured.<br><br>
            He later speculated that the North Vietnamese did not learn of his blinking message until 1974. The taped interview is among the holdings of the Special Media Archives—Records of the Central Intelligence Agency.<br><br>
            Promoted during his captivity, Captain Denton was released on February 12, 1973. After retiring from the U.S. Navy as a rear admiral, he was elected to the U.S. Senate where he served from 1981 until 1987.

        <h3>Columbian Army sends a hidden message in Morse Code through a pop song</h3>
        <p>
            During the Colombian conflict, a low-intensity asymmetric war between the Colombian government and various paramilitary and guerrilla forces, over 6,800 people had been kidnapped by far-left guerrilla group FARC.<br><br>
            In 2010, the Colombian army discovered a hostage camp deep in the jungle guarded by armed FARC guerrillas. There were approximately 500 soldiers held hostage in this camp, and some had been there for more than 10 years. The Colombian army had infiltrated the controlled territory and were planning to free the soldiers soon. They needed some way to let them know that help was coming. Colonel Jose Espejo reached out to his close friend, an advertising executive named Juan Carlos Ortiz, who had helped the Colombian army with anti-FARC advertisements in the past.<br><br>
            Espejo told Ortiz that he needed a way to covertly let the captured soldiers know that they were about to be rescued. In general, it is very risky to try to pass on messages to captives, because anything captives can see, the captors will likely also see. They eventually came up with the idea to write a pop song that contained a hidden message and air it on the Colombian government-controlled radio stations that the FARC often listened to.<br><br>

            The song is a hopeful dance-pop track about how difficult situations will improve, and hidden in the chorus is Morse code disguised as a European dance beat. The message says, <b>"19 Liberados. Siguen Ustedes. Animo." or "19 people rescued. Youre next. Don't lose hope."</b> This was to let the soldiers held hostage know that the Colombian army was infiltrating FARC-controlled areas and coming to rescue them.<br><br>
            
            The song was played on over 130 small radio stations and heard by three million people. The Colombian military controlled all of the local radio stations that the FARC would have access to. Crucially, Major General Luis Herlindo Mendieta Ovalle helped the operation by appearing on live television and appealing to the guerrillas directly. He requested that the radio be played for their captives, supposedly so they could hear the voices of their families, who called into radio shows frequently. In reality, it was so they could hear this song and know they were about to be rescued.<br><br>
